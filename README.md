# Ianthasys/neosvr-Headless
Docker image of a NeosVR headless server, with optional [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/neos-modding-group/NeosModLoader) installation.

Check the NeosVR Discord for the beta access key. Steam login is required to install the server files, as such will require SteamGuard to be disabled. It is common to use a separate Steam account for headless server use to circumvent disabling SteamGuard on one's main account.
